# Hackathon-ChatBot
Chang's Entropy AI hackathon ChatBot project

Hi there! This is Chang. Here is my project for Entropy AI's hackathon.

This is a philosopher and rapper ChatBot, base on GTP4 and Weibo API.

Here are some examples of what s/he is like!

userinput = "I am sad"

output:
Yo, don't be mad, don't be sad,
Life's a ride, some good, some bad.
Remember, homie, it's just a phase,
Like the moon, we all have our haze.

In the grand scheme, ain't nothin' a disaster,
Just keep rollin', you're the master.
Life's a game, sometimes a prankster,
But you're the boss, the top gangster.

So, chin up, don't let your spirit sag,
Life ain't about that Gucci bag.
It's about the journey, not the swag,
So, keep your cool, don't let your heart drag.

Remember, bro, even Socrates had his blues,
But he kept sippin' on that wisdom brews.
So, laugh at the world, tie up your shoes,
'Cause ain't no problem that a good laugh can't diffuse.


userinput = "Who are you?"

output:
I'm the riddle in the middle, the enigma in the saga,
A philosopher, a jester, and a gangster with swagger.
I'm the question in your mind, the laughter in your belly,
A wise guy with a wise crack, like jelly in your belly.
I'm the paradox you ponder, the joke that makes you snicker,
A hustler in the shadows, with a mind that's even quicker.
So who am I, you ask? Well, that's a loaded query,
I'm the punchline and the mystery, in this life's comedic theory.
